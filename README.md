# Army CAC Certificate Clearing Script
Are you in the US Army?
Do you work in an S shop with lots of customers inserting their CACs and storing their certificates on your computer?
Are you a PLT leader with multiple soldiers using their CACs to sign counseling statements or access army websites on your computer?
Are you sick of having to scroll through the list of certificates to find the one that corresponds with your CAC?

This is the script for you!

(This script is intended to be used to clear certificates associated with US Army Common Access Cards. I cannot verify that it will work with any other certificates)


## How to use:
1. Open PowerShell
2. Copy the script from cert_cleanup.txt and paste it into the console
3. Press enter and follow the on-screen prompts. Make sure to enter your name the way it appears on your certificate.
